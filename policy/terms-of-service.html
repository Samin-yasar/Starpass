            <div class="in-short">In Short: PWA offers offline use but may have risks; install and manage carefully.</div>
            <p>Starpass Generator can be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline use via supported browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge) by following the installation prompt.

            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring your browser and device support PWA installation and updates.</li>
                <li>Securing stored data, as the PWA may cache generated credentials locally, which could be accessed if your device is compromised.</li>
                <li>Monitoring storage usage, as excessive caching may impact device performance.</li>
                <li>Uninstalling theÃ©tude

            <li>the PWA if issues arise, using your browserâ€™s settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not guarantee PWA compatibility, stability, or security, and you use this feature at your own risk.</p>

            <p>We may update Starpass Generatorâ€™s features or interface, including PWA functionality. Changes will be reflected in the app, this Terms document, or the GitHub repository. Community input is welcome via <a href="https://github.com/Samin-yasar/Starpass" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>13. Entire Agreement</h2>
            <div class="in-short">In Short: These Terms complement the GPLv3.</div>
            <p>These Terms, alongside the <a href="https://github.com/Samin-yasar/Starpass/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank">GPLv3</a>, form the entire agreement. If any provision is invalid, the remaining terms and license terms remain in effect.</p>
