            <h2>11. PWA Installation</h2>
            <div class="in-short">In Short: PWA offers offline use but may have risks; install and manage carefully.</div>
            <p>Starpass Generator can be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline use via supported browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge) by following the installation prompt. This enables local credential generation without an internet connection, leveraging your device’s storage. However, you are responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring your browser and device support PWA installation and updates.</li>
                <li>Securing stored data, as the PWA may cache generated credentials locally, which could be accessed if your device is compromised.</li>
                <li>Monitoring storage usage, as excessive caching may impact device performance.</li>
                <li>Uninstalling theétude

            <li>the PWA if issues arise, using your browser’s settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not guarantee PWA compatibility, stability, or security, and you use this feature at your own risk.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>12. Changes to the Service</h2>
            <div class="in-short">In Short: We may update features; community input via GitHub is welcome.</div>
            <p>We may update Starpass Generator’s features or interface, including PWA functionality. Changes will be reflected in the app, this Terms document, or the GitHub repository. Community input is welcome via <a href="https://github.com/Samin-yasar/Starpass" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>13. Entire Agreement</h2>
            <div class="in-short">In Short: These Terms complement the GPLv3.</div>
            <p>These Terms, alongside the <a href="https://github.com/Samin-yasar/Starpass/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank">GPLv3</a>, form the entire agreement. If any provision is invalid, the remaining terms and license terms remain in effect.</p>
