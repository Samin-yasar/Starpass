  <h2 id="section1">1. What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
  <h3>Personal Information You Disclose to Us</h3>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Starpass collects no personal information during normal use; only support requests may include voluntarily provided data.</p>
  <p>Starpass generates passwords, passphrases, and usernames locally in your browser or PWA, without accounts or external storage. No personal information (e.g., name, email, IP address) is collected during generation or strength analysis. If you contact us for support, you may voluntarily provide details (e.g., email, message), which we collect solely to respond.</p>
  <h3>Sensitive Information</h3>
  <p>Starpass does not process sensitive personal information (e.g., health data under HIPAA, financial details) during generation. If you include sensitive information in support requests, it is processed only to address your query and not retained beyond response.</p>
  <h3>Information from Third Parties</h3>
  <p>Starpass does not fetch third-party data (e.g., APIs) for its core functionality. All word lists and generation logic are embedded locally in the application.</p>

  <h2 id="section2">2. How Do We Process Your Information?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> All processing is local; support requests involve minimal server communication.</p>
  <p>Starpass processes all generation (passwords, passphrases, usernames) and strength analysis locally in your browser or PWA. No data is transmitted unless you submit a support request, in which case your provided details (e.g., email, message) are sent securely to our server for response.</p>

  <h2 id="section3">3. What Legal Bases Do We Rely On to Process Your Information?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Local processing requires no legal basis; support requests rely on consent (GDPR Art. 6(1)(a)).</p>
  <p>Starpass’s zero-knowledge architecture ensures no personal data is collected during generation, requiring no legal basis under GDPR or similar laws. For support requests, we process data based on your explicit consent, provided during submission, in compliance with GDPR, UK GDPR, and other applicable laws.</p>

  <h2 id="section4">4. When and With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> No data is shared except for support request details sent to our server.</p>
  <p>Generated passwords, passphrases, usernames, and analysis data remain local and are not shared. Support request data (e.g., email, message) is sent to our server for response. No data is shared with third parties, business partners, or in business transfers, per our zero-knowledge principle and SOC 2 confidentiality controls.</p>

  <h2 id="section5">5. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Local data persists until cleared; support request data is retained only as needed.</p>
  <p>Generated data and cached PWA content remain in your browser’s local storage until cleared via Starpass’s interface or browser/PWA settings. Support request data is retained on our server only for the time necessary to respond, typically no longer than 30 days, unless required for legal purposes, per GDPR and SOC 2 requirements.</p>

  <h2 id="section6">6. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Local data is secured by your device; support request data is protected with robust measures.</p>
  <p>Local data (generated credentials, cached PWA data) is protected by your device’s and browser’s security features (e.g., encryption, access controls). Support request data is transmitted via HTTPS, stored with AES-256 encryption, and access is restricted to authorized personnel. We implement SOC 2 and CSA-compliant controls (e.g., access logs, audits). If health data is included in requests, HIPAA-compliant safeguards (e.g., minimal use, breach notification) apply. In case of a breach, we will notify affected users and regulators as required by GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA.</p>

  <h2 id="section7">7. What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> You control local data; support request data rights are exercisable by contacting us.</p>
  <p>Under GDPR, you have rights to access, rectify, delete, restrict, or port your data, applicable to support request data. You control local data via Starpass’s interface (e.g., clear cached data) or browser/PWA settings. For support request data, contact us to exercise rights. CCPA grants California residents similar rights, including opting out of data sales (not applicable, as we do not sell data).</p>

  <h2 id="section8">8. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
  <p>Starpass does not use cookies, trackers, or analytics, so Do-Not-Track signals are irrelevant. For California residents, we comply with CCPA and the "Shine The Light" law by not sharing data for marketing.</p>

  <h2 id="section9">9. Do United States Residents Have Specific Privacy Rights?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> CCPA and state laws apply minimally, but you control your data.</p>
  <p>Starpass collects minimal personal information. The following table outlines CCPA categories:</p>
  <table border="1">
    <tr><th>Category</th><th>Examples</th><th>Collected</th></tr>
    <tr><td>A. Identifiers</td><td>Name, email, IP address</td><td>YES (Only optional email in support requests)</td></tr>

  <h2 id="section10">10. Do Other Regions Have Specific Privacy Rights?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Region-specific rights are limited but supported.</p>

  </ul>

  <h2 id="section11">11. Zero-Knowledge Architecture</h2>
  <p>Starpass’s core features (password, passphrase, username generation, strength analysis) use a zero-knowledge architecture, ensuring no data is collected or stored by us, except for support requests.</p>

  <h2 id="section12">12. Client-Side Processing and Limited Server Communication</h2>
  <p>All functionality is executed locally in your browser or PWA. No third-party API calls are made. Support requests involve secure server communication, limited to provided details (e.g., email, message).</p>
